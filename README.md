#Introduction
Terrabot is a Terraria bot written in python. I am aiming to make it a library that can be used to easily create custom Terraria bots by separating Behaviour from the client itself.

#Features at the moment

 - It connects to TShock servers
 - Parses packets like chat and player notifications
 - Chats

#Missing features

 - Connecting to official servers. (It still crashes)
 - Parsing packets like world data
 - An easily used API
